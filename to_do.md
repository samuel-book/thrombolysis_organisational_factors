### Ideas? Feel free to change

* Collate list of organisational factors al SSNAP organisational audit and process data
* Look at covariance
* Simple regression model and XGBoost regression with SHAP
* Forward feature selection (https://michaelallen1966.github.io/titanic/10_feature_selection_2_forward.html)
* A bit of a lit review on thrombolysis and organisational factors



## Stage 2 (Optional) - Predicting actual thrombolysis

* Include a measure of 'thrombolsyability' of local population? e.g. sum of non-hospitals SHAPs for patients
